o init client env
        ~ brew install autossh 
        or port install autossh

o put the emailed files on client (these files are confidentail therefore they are not in the source control
        ~ cat ./ssh_config >> ~/.ssh/config ## or manually check and add the config section
        ~ mv ./*_rsa* ~/.ssh/ && chmod 400 ~/.ssh/*_rsa*

o test ssh connection (key auth)

        ~ ssh first_proxy_host whoami
        
o Network Config [currently only graphical interface tested]
        - System Preferences > Network > Edit Location >  * duplicate Location
                > rename to "Proxied connection"
        - Advanced > Proxies > Automatic Proxy Configuration >
        - Proxy Configuration File (select the ./proxy.pac)

o Usage:
        ~ ./start_proxy.sh start # --- start the proxy and it will be there 
        ~ ./start_proxy.sh status # --- need implementation, we only got pid right now
        ~ ./start_proxy.sh stop # --- stop the proxy (autossh only, but no update of the networksetup, need implementation

o Stop Proxy completely
        ~ ./start_proxy.sh stop # --- stop the proxy (autossh only, but no update of the networksetup, need implementation
        - System Preferences > Network > 
                > delete  "Proxied connection"
